# Life-Logging

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This project aims at developing a simple and unobtrusive life logger.

##Purpose

The Life-Logging project started in the 2011/12 [PVIM](https://fenix.ist.utl.pt/disciplinas/gvip36/2011-2012/2-semestre?locale=en_EN) course at [IST](http://www.ist.utl.pt/en); it is very simple to use and above all really unobtrusive, since the user can control when to execute it.

##Installation

More on that when we finally have something to show you

##Usage

Just press the correct buttons in your keyboard and the life-logger window will popup on your screen
	
##Testing

I'm sure we'll be creating some test suite to go on with this
